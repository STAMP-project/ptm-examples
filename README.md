# Examples of pseudo-tested methods

This project contains simplified versions of scenarios where **pseudo-tested** methods were found by [Descartes](https://github.com/STAMP-project/pitest-descartes) in real open source projects.

The project is intended to be used as a supporting material in teaching activities.

A set of practical activities can be found in [TUTORIAL.md](./TUTORIAL.md)
